# Klard Design System

Welcome to the Klard Design System - the single source of truth for designers and developers building the Klard platform.

## What is Klard?

Klard is an intelligent subscription management platform that helps users:
- **Track subscriptions** and detect price increases
- **Control spending** with BurnerCards that auto-block unwanted charges
- **Save money** by surfacing hidden costs and alternatives

## Design Principles

Our design foundation is rooted in five thematic pillars:

### Visibility
Klard surfaces what is often hidden: renewal dates, price changes, and subscription histories. UI choices reflect transparency through clear typography, structured layouts, and consistent iconography.

### Protection
The BurnerCard system gives users defensive power. Visual components feel secure, stable, and authoritative with strong differentiation for cards, limits, warnings, and rules.

### Automation
Klard reduces manual financial management. Interfaces feel intuitive and self-operating with subtle animations that signal automation without overwhelming.

### Savings
Users interact with the platform to save money. Savings visuals feel rewarding without being gimmicky - calm confident greens, subtle glows, and celebratory micro-copy.

### Control
Every element makes the user feel in charge. Visual patterns emphasize user-initiated actions, clear state indicators, and reversible operations.

## Brand Voice

Klard's voice is **warm, confident, and empowering**. We talk like a smart friend who's genuinely got your back - not paranoid, not preachy, just protective.

**We are NOT a security product - we're a freedom product.**

| Renewal reminder | "Renewal in 3 days" | "Adobe renews in 3 days ($54.99). Keep it, pause it, or burn the card?" |
