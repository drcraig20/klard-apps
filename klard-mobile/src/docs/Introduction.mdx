# Klard Mobile Component Library

Welcome to the Klard Mobile component library - your guide to building consistent experiences in the Klard React Native app.

## What is Klard Mobile?

Klard Mobile is the native mobile application for the Klard subscription management platform, built with **React Native** and **Expo SDK 54**. It empowers users to:

- **Track subscriptions** with real-time notifications and renewal alerts
- **Control spending** using BurnerCards that auto-block unwanted charges
- **Save money** by surfacing hidden costs and celebrating blocked transactions
- **Manage on-the-go** with native haptic feedback and smooth animations

## Design Principles

Our design foundation is rooted in five thematic pillars:

### Visibility
Klard surfaces what is often hidden: renewal dates, price changes, and subscription histories.

### Protection
The BurnerCard system gives users defensive power with secure, stable components.

### Automation
Interfaces feel intuitive and self-operating with subtle animations.

### Savings
Savings visuals feel rewarding - calm confident greens and celebratory micro-copy.

### Control
Every element makes the user feel in charge with user-initiated actions.

## Brand Voice

Klard's voice is **warm, confident, and empowering**. We talk like a smart friend who's genuinely got your back.

**We are NOT a security product - we're a freedom product.**

## Platform Stack

- **React Native 0.81** with Expo SDK 54
- **Expo Router 6** for navigation
- **SVA styling** (Style Variants API) instead of Tailwind
- **Haptic feedback** via expo-haptics
- **Light/Dark themes** via Colors from `@/styles/colors`

1. **Browse Components** - Explore the sidebar to see all available components
2. **Try Controls** - Use the Controls panel to customize component props
3. **Switch Themes** - Use the theme switcher to preview light/dark modes
4. **Copy Patterns** - Each story shows implementation patterns
