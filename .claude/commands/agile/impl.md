# Implement Task: $ARGUMENTS.task_id

## Mandatory Skill Activation

### Step 1 - EVALUATE

- `superpowers:test-driven-development` - YES - TDD workflow
- `superpowers:verification-before-completion` - YES - Verify before claiming done
- `superpowers:testing-anti-patterns` - YES - Avoid testing mistakes
- `solid-design-principles` - YES - Write SOLID code
- `superpowers:brainstorming` - CONDITIONAL - If implementation approach unclear

### Step 2 - ACTIVATE

Use `Skill(superpowers:test-driven-development)` tool NOW.
Use `Skill(superpowers:testing-anti-patterns)` tool NOW.
Use `Skill(solid-design-principles)` tool NOW.
Use `Skill(superpowers:brainstorming)` tool if approach needs exploration.

### Step 3 - PARALLEL AGENT DISPATCH (Context Gathering Only)

**TDD cycle is sequential** (red → green → refactor), BUT context gathering happens in parallel BEFORE:

Dispatch in parallel (single message with multiple Task tool calls):
```
Task 1: Explore agent - "Search task files for $ARGUMENTS.task_id details using Grep"
Task 2: feature-dev:code-explorer - "Analyze files that will be modified/created using Grep patterns"
Task 3: Explore agent - "Find related tests and patterns using Grep"
```

### Step 4 - PROCEED

Only after activating skills and receiving context from parallel agents, continue below.

## Your Role: Assistant (NOT Lead)

**The user is the lead Developer.** You assist with TDD, but they:
- Confirm readiness before each phase
- Validate test approaches
- Decide when implementation is "good enough"
- Approve refactoring changes

---

## Context Engineering Rules

**NEVER read entire files.** Use intelligent, sectional reading:

1. **Use Grep to find relevant sections:**
   ```
   Grep: pattern="class.*ComponentName" path="src/"
   Grep: pattern="function.*methodName" path="src/"
   Grep: pattern="import.*from" path="src/file.ts"
   ```

2. **Use Read with offset/limit for specific lines:**
   ```
   Read: file_path="src/file.ts" offset=45 limit=30
   ```

3. **Summarize, don't dump:**
   - Present key signatures and interfaces
   - Show only relevant code blocks
   - Provide condensed context

---

## Find Task Context (via Parallel Agents)

Using context from dispatched agents:
1. Task details from `docs/agile/tasks/`
2. Load task description, files, subtasks
3. Find related story from `docs/agile/stories/`
4. Check architecture notes from `docs/agile/architecture/`

---

## Fetch Library Documentation (MANDATORY)

**BEFORE writing any code that uses external libraries, you MUST:**

1. **Resolve library ID:**
   ```
   mcp__context7__resolve-library-id: libraryName="[library-name]"
   ```

2. **Fetch current documentation:**
   ```
   mcp__context7__get-library-docs:
     context7CompatibleLibraryID="[resolved-id]"
     topic="[relevant-topic]"
     mode="code"
   ```

3. **Present key patterns to user:**
   ```
   📚 LIBRARY DOCUMENTATION (Context7)

   **[Library Name] - Latest Patterns:**
   - [Key API pattern 1]
   - [Key API pattern 2]

   🎯 DEVELOPER CONFIRMATION:
   Ready to proceed with these patterns?
   ```

**DO NOT skip this step.** Training data may have outdated patterns.

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

```
✅ PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECK

- [ ] Task dependencies are complete
- [ ] Understand acceptance criteria
- [ ] Know which files to modify/create
- [ ] **Library docs fetched via Context7 MCP** (MANDATORY if using libraries)
- [ ] Test framework identified

🎯 DEVELOPER CONFIRMATION:
Ready to proceed?
```

---

## TDD Cycle: Red → Green → Refactor

### 1. RED: Write Failing Tests

**Following superpowers:test-driven-development skill:**

Write tests FIRST that describe expected behavior.

```
🔴 RED PHASE

Writing failing test for: [behavior]

[Show complete test code]

Running: `pnpm test path/to/test.ts --run`
Expected: FAIL with "[specific error]"

🎯 Actual result: [show output]
```

### 2. GREEN: Write Minimum Code

```
🟢 GREEN PHASE

Implementing minimal code to pass:

[Show implementation]

Running: `pnpm test path/to/test.ts --run`
Expected: PASS

🎯 Actual result: [show output]
```

### 3. REFACTOR: Clean Up

```
🔵 REFACTOR PHASE

Improvements:
- [what was improved]

Running tests: STILL PASSING ✅
Running lint: PASSING ✅
```

---

## Verification Before Completion

**Following superpowers:verification-before-completion skill:**

```
✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Run these commands and confirm output:

- [ ] `pnpm test path/to/test.ts --run` → PASS
- [ ] `pnpm lint` → No errors
- [ ] `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` → No errors

🎯 VERIFICATION RESULTS:
[Show actual output from each command]

Only mark complete AFTER showing evidence.
```

---

## Context Persistence (Per Task)

After each task completion, update context:

### 1. Decision Log (if decisions made)
Append to `docs/agile/context/<feature>-decisions.md`:
```markdown
## Implementation Decision - $ARGUMENTS.task_id - [DATE]

| Decision | Options | Chosen | Rationale |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| [implementation choice] | [options] | [choice] | [why] |
```

### 2. Update Handoff Context
Update `docs/agile/context/<feature>-impl-progress.md`:
```markdown
# Implementation Progress: <feature>

**Last Updated:** [DATE]
**Current Task:** $ARGUMENTS.task_id

## Completed Tasks
| Task ID | Status | Files Changed | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------------|-------|
| FEAT-001-01 | ✅ | [files] | [notes] |

## In Progress
- $ARGUMENTS.task_id: [current status]

## Patterns Established
- [pattern 1]: [where used]
- [pattern 2]: [where used]

## Libraries Used (Context7)
- [library]: [version] - [why]

## Technical Debt / Follow-ups
- [ ] [item 1]
- [ ] [item 2]
```

---

## Update Task Board

After verification:
1. Open `docs/agile/boards/<feature>-board.md`
2. Move task to "Done"
3. Add completion marker: `✓`

---

## Commit Changes

```bash
git add [files]
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>

Refs: $ARGUMENTS.task_id"
```

---

## Next Steps

```
✅ Task $ARGUMENTS.task_id complete.

Next task: Run `/agile:board` to see remaining tasks.
All tasks done? Run `/agile:qa` to start quality assurance.
```
