# Product Brief: klard-apps

**Date:** 2025-12-19
**Author:** Drcraig

---

## Executive Summary

Imagine signing up for a free trial without fear. Seven days later, when the service tries to charge you, your Klard BurnerCard has already locked. You get a notification: *'🛡️ Blocked: $14.99 from TrialService—your BurnerCard did its job.'* That feeling of control, of protection, of freedom to explore? That's Klard.

**Klard** is a subscription intelligence and protection platform that lets users try any service without sharing their real card. We combine subscription tracking with smart virtual cards (BurnerCards) that automatically block unwanted renewals, protect trial sign-ups, and put users in complete control of their recurring payments.

**Our tagline:** *Subscribe fearlessly.*

**Our thesis:** Users shouldn't have to choose between curiosity and safety. Klard eliminates this false choice by delivering full subscription visibility and automated protection—without ever asking for bank credentials.

**Business Model:** Premium-only with a generous 30-day trial (no credit card required). Trial includes full BurnerCard access so users experience the core protection value before committing. Research shows premium users deliver 7x higher lifetime value than freemium users.

**Target Markets:** Built for global scale. Now available in Canada, US, UK, and EU—with more regions coming.

**Sustainable Advantage:** As users share 'Klard blocked $X' screenshots, we build a social proof flywheel. As subscription pricing data accumulates globally, our price alerts become more accurate than anyone else's. First-mover status plus network effects plus data moat equals durable differentiation.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

The subscription economy has created a hidden "leakage economy" where users unknowingly lose hundreds of dollars annually. The problem manifests across five pain points:

1. **Privacy risk** (PRIMARY): Users feel unsafe giving credit card details to unknown vendors and trial services
2. **Lack of control**: No automated way to block renewals after a trial or one-time payment completes
3. **Visibility gap**: Subscriptions scattered across email receipts, bank statements, and memory
4. **Silent price increases**: Vendors raise prices without notification; users discover charges after the fact
5. **Cancellation friction**: Hard-to-find cancellation links designed to discourage users from leaving

**The #1 pain point is privacy.** Users want to try services but dread sharing their real payment information with every vendor. Current solutions force an impossible choice: bank access for convenience, or privacy at the cost of manual tracking.

### Problem Impact

- **41% of consumers** experience subscription fatigue
- **30% of annual subscriptions** are cancelled within the first month (buyer's remorse)
- **50%+ of trial starts** happen in the first 24 hours—users are impulse signing up without protection
- Average consumer spends **$133/month ($1,600/year)** on subscriptions, with significant hidden waste
- Data breaches have made users hyper-aware of payment data exposure

The psychological toll is real: users feel anxious about trials, paranoid about forgotten renewals, and powerless against "subscription creep."

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Solution | What They Do | Why They Fall Short |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Rocket Money / Truebill** | Subscription tracking + bill negotiation | **Requires full bank access**—privacy violation for many users |
| **Privacy.com** | Virtual cards for payment protection | **No subscription intelligence**—cards exist in isolation from tracking |
| **Bobby** | Privacy-first manual subscription tracking | **iOS-only, manual entry, no protection**—tracks but doesn't prevent |
| **Banks** | Transaction history | **No categorization, alerts, or protection**—purely reactive |

**The gap:** No solution combines subscription discovery + protection without requiring bank credentials. Users must choose between knowing their subscriptions OR protecting their payments. Klard is the first platform to bridge both worlds.

### Proposed Solution

**Klard bridges subscription intelligence and payment protection in a single platform—without ever asking for bank credentials.**

**Core Value Loop:**
1. **Track**: Add subscriptions manually or via optional email scanning (read-once, privacy-first)
2. **Protect**: Create BurnerCards with smart rules—one-time use, spending limits, auto-lock after trial period
3. **Save**: Receive renewal alerts, price-increase notifications, and cancellation links
4. **Control**: Lock, pause, or "rage quit" cards instantly when protection is needed

**How We Protect Your Data:**
Your full card details live securely with our PCI-certified payment partners. Klard stores only reference tokens—so even if our systems were breached, your card numbers stay safe. Your bank credentials? We never ask for them.

### Key Differentiators

| Differentiator | What It Means | Why It Matters |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Try Anything, Risk Nothing** | BurnerCards let users explore services without exposing real payment info | Users with privacy concerns finally have a premium option |
| **Integrated Intelligence + Protection** | Virtual cards with subscription-aware rules (one-time, recurring limits, category locks) | The only platform combining discovery + prevention |
| **Built for Global Scale** | Multi-currency support across Canada, US, UK, and EU with more regions coming | No major competitor serves international users well |
| **Self-Service Empowerment** | Users control their cards directly vs. concierge "we'll cancel for you" models | Aligns with user demand for autonomy and instant action |
| **Premium Positioning** | No free tier; generous trial proves value before commitment | Attracts high-value users (7x LTV vs. freemium) |

**Sustainable Moat:**
1. **Data Moat**: Anonymized global subscription pricing becomes industry's most accurate reference
2. **Brand Trust**: Every "Klard blocked $X" screenshot builds social proof flywheel
3. **Switching Costs**: Users accumulate card history, rules, and subscription data
4. **First-Mover Integration**: Deep card issuer partnerships with preferential rates

## Credit Card Objection Handling

### The Classic Objection

> *"Why do I need Klard? I already have a credit card. I can pay at the end of the month and I get rewards."*

### Why Credit Cards Don't Solve This Problem

**What problem does a credit card actually solve for subscription management?**

- Does your credit card tell you Netflix raised prices by $3/month? **No.**
- Does it decline a charge when a free trial converts to $49.99? **No.**
- Does it show you all your subscriptions in one place? **No.**
- Does it give you a one-time card for that sketchy trial you want to try? **No.**

Credit cards are **approval machines**. They say YES to everything. Klard says YES when you want, and NO when you don't. That's the difference between a payment tool and a **control** tool.

### The Data Reality

| Metric | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **Average subscription waste** | $252/year per person (C+R Research, 2023) |
| **Credit card rewards** | ~1-2% cashback = ~$20-40/year on subscriptions |
| **Net loss** | You're losing **$200+/year** even WITH rewards |

The "I get rewards" argument actually **reinforces** our value prop. You're earning $30 in rewards while losing $250 to forgotten subscriptions. That's not smart money management—that's a leaky bucket with a pretty bow.

### Systems Comparison

| Credit Card | Klard |
|-------------|-------|
| **Payment rail** (moves money) | **Control layer** (decides IF money moves) |
| Approves all authorized charges | Approves only what YOU want |
| Reactive (dispute after the fact) | Proactive (block before it happens) |
| No subscription intelligence | Full subscription visibility |

They're not competitors—they're **layers**. Klard sits between you and the merchant. Your credit card sits between Klard and the bank. We're the bouncer; they're the cashier.

### The Emotional Reality

> *"I signed up for a 7-day trial of some productivity app. Set a reminder to cancel. Forgot. Got charged $89.99 for an annual plan. Called my credit card—they said it was a valid charge because I agreed to the terms. Spent 45 minutes trying to get a refund from a company with no phone number."*

Credit cards don't protect you from **yourself**. Klard does. The "pay end of month" argument misses the point entirely—**the problem isn't WHEN you pay, it's WHETHER you wanted to pay at all.**

### Investor-Ready Answer

> **"Credit cards are designed to approve every charge. Klard is designed to approve only the charges you want. We're not replacing your credit card—we're adding an intelligence layer that prevents the $250/year in subscription waste that credit card rewards will never cover."**

**If they push on rewards, flip it:**

> **"Would you rather earn 2% back on charges you didn't want, or not pay for things you forgot to cancel? Klard saves users 10x more than credit card rewards ever could."**

### The "I'll Just Check My Statement" Objection

| Self-Management Claim | Reality |
|----------------------|---------|
| *"I'll review my statements"* | 85% of people don't audit subscriptions monthly |
| *"I'll set reminders"* | 62% of free trial users forget to cancel |
| *"I'll just dispute it"* | Average dispute takes 45+ minutes, often denied |

Klard automates what humans consistently fail to do. That's not a nice-to-have—that's a **behavior gap** we fill.

### Quick Reference: Objection Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| *"Credit cards already exist"* | Credit cards approve everything. Klard gives you control over WHAT gets approved. |
| *"I can pay at end of month"* | The problem isn't WHEN you pay—it's paying for things you forgot to cancel. |
| *"I get rewards"* | 2% rewards don't offset $250/year in subscription waste. Klard saves 10x more. |
| *"I just check my statement"* | 85% of people don't audit subscriptions monthly. Klard does it automatically. |

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | What It Means | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Confident, not cocky** | We know we're good, but we don't brag | 'Your card blocked a charge' not 'We saved you again!' |
| **Warm, not corporate** | Talk like a smart friend, not a bank | 'Heads up—Netflix raised prices' not 'Price increase alert detected' |
| **Empowering, not fearful** | Focus on freedom, not danger | 'Try anything' not 'Protect yourself from scams' |
| **Clear, not clever** | Clarity beats puns | 'One-time card: works once, then locks' not 'Use it and lose it!' |

### What Klard Is NOT
- Not a security product (we're a freedom product)
- Not a budgeting app (we're about control, not restriction)
- Not a bank (we're the card between you and the world)

### Sample Notifications (Brand Voice Applied)

| Moment | Generic | Klard Voice |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Blocked charge | 'Transaction declined' | '🛡️ Blocked: $14.99 from TrialService. Your BurnerCard did its job.' |
| Price increase | 'Price change detected' | '📈 Heads up: Spotify went from $12.99 → $14.99. Want to see alternatives?' |
| Renewal reminder | 'Renewal in 3 days' | '⏰ Adobe renews in 3 days ($54.99). Keep it, pause it, or burn the card?' |
| Trial ending | 'Trial expires soon' | '🎯 Your Canva trial ends tomorrow. Card's ready to block if you don't want it.'

---

## Target Users

### User Segmentation Strategy

Klard targets **high subscription spenders** as primary users, with secondary focus on privacy-conscious users and team/agency use cases. Research shows Gen Z and Millennials (42-44% spend $100+/month on subscriptions) are the core demographic experiencing subscription fatigue most acutely.

**Segmentation:**
- **P1 (Primary):** High spenders and trial-heavy users who value protection and peace of mind
- **P2 (Secondary):** Privacy advocates and team/agency users (team features in Phase 2)

### Primary Users (P1)

#### Harper — The High-Value Professional
> *"I spend over $400/month on subscriptions. I don't have time to track them—I just want them handled."*

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Age** | 32 |
| **Generation** | Millennial |
| **Location** | London, UK |
| **Occupation** | VP of Product at a Scale-Up |
| **Monthly Spend** | $400-600+ |
| **Subscriptions** | 45+ (personal + family) |
| **Device Preference** | 📱 Mobile-first (checking on-the-go between meetings) |

**Profile:** Harper runs product at a 200-person tech company. She has two kids (ages 4 and 7), a husband who adds subscriptions without telling her, and a side project newsletter she keeps meaning to monetize. Her weekends are spent shuttling kids to activities while half-listening to podcasts. She's accumulated subscriptions across every category—family streaming (Disney+, Netflix, Apple TV+), news (NYT, The Athletic, The Economist), fitness (Peloton, Headspace), productivity (Notion, Linear), and a graveyard of SaaS tools from her side project.

She KNOWS she's overspending—last month she found a Masterclass subscription she'd had for 2 years and never used. But auditing 45+ subscriptions feels like a Saturday project she'll never get to. She values peace of mind over saving money—she just wants to know nothing's slipping through.

**Pain Points:**
- Suspects $100+/month in waste but can't prove it (she was right—it was $127)
- Too busy to track—needs "set and forget" solution
- Privacy-conscious (won't connect bank accounts after reading about data breaches)
- Husband adds family subscriptions without coordination

**Emotional State:**
- 😰 **Before Klard:** Anxious, guilty, vaguely aware money is leaking
- 😌 **After Klard:** Protected, in control, "financial security blanket" in place

**Success Moment:** Sets up Klard during a 15-minute coffee break using suggestion checkboxes. Discovers 5 forgotten subscriptions ($87/month) within a week. Creates BurnerCards for all future trials. Now has visibility without effort.

---

#### Felix — The Freelancer
> *"I've signed up for so many tools I've lost track. Every month there's a surprise charge."*

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Age** | 26 |
| **Generation** | Gen Z |
| **Location** | Toronto, Canada |
| **Occupation** | Freelance UX Designer |
| **Monthly Spend** | $180-280 |
| **Subscriptions** | 25-35 active |
| **Device Preference** | 💻 Desktop-first (at workstation during work hours) |

**Profile:** Felix runs his own design practice from a co-working space. He's constantly testing new tools—AI assistants, design software, productivity apps. Every week there's a new "game-changing" tool someone in his Discord recommends. He signs up for trials intending to cancel, but by day 7 he's onto the next shiny thing.

His credit card statement is a graveyard of $9.99 and $19.99 charges for tools he used once. He's embarrassed to admit he probably wastes $50+/month on forgotten trials. His freelancer friends joke about "subscription shame."

**Pain Points:**
- Signs up for trials constantly, forgets to cancel
- Gets charged for tools he tried once and abandoned
- Uses personal card for everything (no protection layer)
- Embarrassed by monthly waste when he sees bank statement

**Emotional State:**
- 😓 **Before Klard:** Embarrassed, reactive, dreading credit card statements
- 😎 **After Klard:** Confident, proactive, "I can try anything now"

**Success Moment:** Creates a BurnerCard for a new AI tool. 7-day trial. Not impressed. Card auto-locks. Vendor tries to charge $29/month. Blocked. Screenshots notification and shares with freelancer Slack: *"This app just paid for itself."*

#### Fiona — The Fatigued
> *"I'm drowning in subscriptions. I need to simplify my life."*

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Age** | 28 |
| **Generation** | Gen Z |
| **Location** | New York, US |
| **Occupation** | Senior Marketing Manager |
| **Monthly Spend** | $200-350 |
| **Subscriptions** | 30+ |
| **Device Preference** | 📱 Mobile-first (uses apps on subway commute) |

**Profile:** Fiona's subscriptions have accumulated like sediment over 8 years of adult life. Streaming services she signed up for in college. A meal kit from when she tried to cook more. A meditation app from a New Year's resolution. A beauty box she forgot to pause. She doesn't even know what she's paying for anymore.

She feels overwhelmed by "subscription creep" and wants to actively REDUCE, not just track. She's part of the 41% experiencing subscription fatigue. She tried RocketMoney but closed it immediately when it asked for bank access—that felt more invasive than the problem itself.

**Pain Points:**
- Overwhelmed by subscription accumulation spanning 8+ years
- Wants to simplify and reduce, not just track
- Uncomfortable with bank-connected apps (privacy concern)
- Has subscriptions she literally doesn't remember signing up for

**Emotional State:**
- 😫 **Before Klard:** Overwhelmed, guilty, paralyzed by complexity
- 😊 **After Klard:** Lighter, clearer, "I actually know what I'm paying for"

**Success Moment:** Uses Klard's health indicators to audit her portfolio. Discovers she's paying for 4 streaming services but actively uses 2. Cancels extras using Klard's cancellation links. Saves $52/month. Tells friends: *"I feel 10 pounds lighter."*

---

#### Sam — The Student
> *"I'm always trying free trials. I've been charged so many times for stuff I forgot."*

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Age** | 21 |
| **Generation** | Gen Z |
| **Location** | Montreal, Canada |
| **Occupation** | Graduate Student |
| **Monthly Spend** | $50-80 |
| **Subscriptions** | 8-12 |
| **Device Preference** | 📱 Mobile-first (phone is primary device) |

**Profile:** Sam is on a tight graduate student budget where literally every dollar counts. He constantly signs up for free trials—video editing software for a class project, streaming services to watch a specific show, productivity tools his classmates recommend. He's been burned multiple times by forgotten cancellations.

Last semester, he got charged $79 for an annual subscription to software he used for one assignment. He doesn't trust himself to remember cancellation dates. His friends have the same problem—they joke about "trial trauma."

**Pain Points:**
- Limited budget—$79 unexpected charge is a disaster
- Signs up for trials constantly for school projects
- Has been charged unexpectedly at least 5 times
- Doesn't trust himself to remember cancellation dates

**Emotional State:**
- 😨 **Before Klard:** Paranoid about trials, avoids signing up for useful tools
- 🎯 **After Klard:** Fearless, tries anything knowing he's protected

**Success Moment:** Needs video editing software for a class project. 30-day trial gives plenty of time. Creates one-time BurnerCard. Finishes project in 10 days. Card already locked. Vendor can't charge. Shares with entire study group: *"Game-changer for students."*

---

### Secondary Users (P2)

#### Pete — The Privacy-Conscious
> *"I won't use apps that want my bank login. I've been waiting for something like Klard."*

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Age** | 27 |
| **Generation** | Gen Z |
| **Location** | Berlin, Germany |
| **Occupation** | Software Engineer (Security) |
| **Monthly Spend** | $120-200 |
| **Subscriptions** | 15-20 |
| **Device Preference** | 💻 Desktop-first (power user, keyboard-driven) |

**Profile:** Pete works in application security and has researched every subscription tracker on the market. He's rejected all of them due to bank access requirements—he knows exactly what that data access enables. He uses Privacy.com for virtual cards but is frustrated that it has zero subscription awareness—cards exist in isolation with no tracking.

He wants RocketMoney's intelligence combined with Privacy.com's architecture. He's been waiting for someone to build this.

**Pain Points:**
- Rejected every tracker due to bank access requirements
- Privacy.com lacks subscription awareness
- Wants integrated intelligence + protection
- Will verify security claims before trusting

**Emotional State:**
- 🤨 **Before Klard:** Skeptical, resigned to manual tracking
- 🛡️ **After Klard:** Validated, becomes technical advocate

**Success Moment:** Discovers Klard's tokenization model. Reviews the architecture documentation. Satisfied with security approach. Migrates all subscriptions. Becomes advocate in developer communities: *"Finally, someone built this right."*

---

#### Amy — The Agency Owner *(Phase 2 Target)*
> *"My team has subscriptions everywhere. I need visibility and budget control."*

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Age** | 34 |
| **Generation** | Millennial |
| **Location** | Austin, US |
| **Occupation** | Founder, 8-person Design Agency |
| **Monthly Spend** | $300-500 (business) |
| **Subscriptions** | 20-30 business tools |
| **Device Preference** | 💻 Desktop-first (managing from office) |

**Note:** Amy's full success scenario requires team visibility and shared budget controls—features planned for Phase 2. In MVP, Amy can use Klard for her personal subscriptions and individual business tools, but full agency use case unlocks in Phase 2.

**Profile:** Amy runs a small design agency. Her team signs up for tools constantly—sometimes with approval, sometimes without. She has no central visibility into what they're paying for, and vendors auto-renew at higher rates. She needs budget guardrails without micromanaging.

**Pain Points:**
- Team members sign up for tools without approval
- No central visibility into SaaS spend
- Vendors auto-renew at higher rates
- Needs budget controls per category

**Emotional State:**
- 😤 **Before Klard:** Frustrated, no control, reactive
- 🎛️ **After Klard (Phase 2):** In control, proactive guardrails

**Success Moment (Phase 2):** Creates category-locked BurnerCards for the team. Rogue subscriptions automatically declined if they exceed budget or wrong category. *"Finally, guardrails."*

### Card Issuer Strategy

| Provider | Role | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **Airwallex** | Primary (MVP) | Global coverage (Canada, US, UK, EU), Remote Authorization, PCI Level 1 |
| **Lithic** | Backup | Developer-friendly, fast onboarding, US-focused |
| **Stripe Issuing** | Deferred | PCI-DSS requirements for service providers add complexity |

**Critical Week 1 Action:** Start Airwallex application immediately (approval takes 2-4 weeks).

---

### Card Storage Strategy

| Data | Storage Location | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| Full card number | **Never stored** | Display via Airwallex secure iframe only |
| Masked PAN | Your database | `**** **** **** 1234` |
| Expiry date | Your database | For display purposes |
| Card token/reference | Your database | Airwallex card ID |
| Card rules | Your database | User-defined limits and types |

**PCI Strategy:**
- **MVP:** Iframe-based card display (no PCI scope, SAQ A only)
- **Future:** Full PCI-DSS compliance when needed for advanced features

---

### Funding Architecture

**Model:** Option A — Pooled Klard Wallet with Internal Ledger

```
User pays via Stripe → Klard credits internal ledger → Cards draw from Klard's Airwallex wallet
```

| Component | Approach | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Ledger** | Build your own (Java) | Provider-agnostic, full control |
| **User top-up** | Stripe payments | Familiar UX, fast integration |
| **Card funding** | Airwallex wallet | Single pool, Klard reconciles internally |
| **Authorization** | Remote Authorization webhook | Real-time approve/decline based on user balance |

**Ledger Tables:**
- `user_wallets` (user_id, balance, currency, updated_at)
- `transactions` (id, user_id, type, amount, reference, timestamp)
- `airwallex_reconciliation` (card_txn_id, user_id, amount)

**Provider Abstraction:**
- `CardProviderInterface` defines: createCard(), lockCard(), handleAuthorization()
- `AirwallexAdapter` implements for MVP
- Swap to Lithic/Stripe later without changing core logic

---

### Email Scanning Architecture

| Aspect | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **Integration** | LLM-based service for email categorization and receipt parsing |
| **Access Level** | Read-only access to user's email |
| **User Control** | Optional feature, users opt-in explicitly |
| **Privacy** | Read-once, extract subscription data, don't store email content |

**User Guidance:** Advise users to remove original cards from service providers and use BurnerCards for full subscription control and tracking.

---

### Out of Scope (Phase 2+)

| Feature | Phase | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Price-increase detection | Phase 2 | Requires web scraping infrastructure |
| Alternative finder | Phase 2 | Affiliate integration complexity |
| Physical cards | Phase 3 | Virtual cards solve core problem |
| Team/Family features | Phase 3 | B2B pivot, different user journey |
| Full PCI-DSS compliance | Future | Start with iframe approach |
| Multiple card providers | Future | Architecture ready, implement when needed |
