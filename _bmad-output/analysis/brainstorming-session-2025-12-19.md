# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Drcraig
**Agent:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Date:** 2025-12-19
**Duration:** Complete 4-phase session

---

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Comprehensive Klard Platform Strategy - Product, Technical, and Go-to-Market Development

**Goals:** Generate actionable ideas across features, implementation, marketing, user journeys, onboarding, retention, and pricing strategy

### Research Foundation

This session builds on comprehensive competitive market research completed 2025-12-19, analyzing subscription management platforms (RocketMoney, Bobby, PocketGuard, Privacy.com, etc.) and identifying 7 high-priority differentiation opportunities for Klard.

**Key Market Insights:**
- 41% of consumers experience subscription fatigue
- Users prioritize psychological safety over cost optimization (premium pricing = 7x LTV)
- 50% of trial conversions happen in first 24 hours (critical onboarding window)
- 30% of annual subscriptions cancelled in first month (retention crisis)
- Global market gap: all major players are US-only or iOS-only
- No integrated solution combining subscription discovery + burner card prevention
- Users demand self-service empowerment over concierge models

### Key Decisions Made During Session

1. **Launch Markets:** Canada + US first (user is based in Canada)
2. **Card Provider Options:** Airwallex, Lithic, or Stripe (decision pending)
3. **Pricing Model:** Premium-only with generous trial recommended (vs. PRD's Free tier)
4. **Privacy Approach:** Privacy by architecture, not UI dashboard
5. **Card Automation:** User-configurable in settings (not forced)

## Phase 3: SCAMPER — 4 Refined Concepts

### Concept 1: Smart Visual Cards

**Core Elements (from SCAMPER):**
- **M (Modify):** Card designs that match subscription logos—instantly recognizable
- **P (Put to other use):** "One-time protection mode" for sketchy e-commerce sites
- **E (Eliminate):** Remove manual card creation—auto-generate on subscription add *(configurable in settings)*
- **R (Reverse):** Subscriptions auto-create cards with approval *(configurable in settings)*

**Final Definition:**
> Auto-generated, visually-branded cards matching subscription logos. One-time protection available for non-subscription purchases. User chooses automation level: manual-only, auto-generate on add, or subscriptions spawn cards automatically. Full control in settings.

### Concept 2: Smart Onboarding

**Core Elements (from SCAMPER):**
- **P (Put to other use):** First 3 subscriptions = forever-personalized recommendations
- **R (Reverse):** WE tell THEM their subscriptions: "Do you have Netflix? Spotify?" Checkboxes

**Final Definition:**
> Klard suggests likely subscriptions based on popularity/persona. User checks boxes. First 3 selections drive personalized experience forever. No forms, no friction—just recognition.

### Concept 3: Shareable Savings

**Core Elements (from SCAMPER):**
- **P (Put to other use):** Savings data is SHAREABLE for word-of-mouth growth

**Final Definition:**
> Savings counter with shareable milestone cards: "I saved $X with Klard this month" for social proof and organic growth.

### Concept 4: Global Price Intelligence

**Core Elements (from SCAMPER):**
- **P (Put to other use):** Global data creates market INSIGHTS: "Netflix costs 40% less in Argentina"

**Final Definition:**
> Aggregated, anonymized global data powering pricing insights: "This subscription costs X% more/less in other regions." Premium feature for informed decision-making.

## Existing Card Rules System (From Documentation)

Your existing documentation already defines a comprehensive card rules system:

### Card Types

| Type | Description | Expiry Rules |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **One-Time** | Single use, auto-locks after first charge | Auto-lock timing: 7/14/30/60 days or never |
| **Recurring** | Multiple charges up to limits | Lock after X charges, $X spent, or specific date |
| **Category** | Works only for specific merchant categories | Category whitelist (Streaming, Software, Gaming, Health, Food, Shopping, Travel, Other) |

### Configurable Rules (All Cards)

- **Spending Limit:** $1-$10,000 per card
- **Card Nickname:** Max 30 characters
- **Notifications:** Every charge, 80% limit reached (toggleable)
- **Linked Subscription:** Optional subscription association

### Card States

- **Active** (teal)
- **Locked** (amber)
- **Expired** (gray)
- **Used** (one-time only, grayed)

### Card Intelligence Features (Specified in Screen Docs - Not Yet Implemented)

- Transaction history with decline reasons ("Exceeded limit", "Card locked", "Invalid category")
- Lock/Unlock toggle with immediate effect
- Visual card designs with service logos (BurnerCardVisual component exists but card logic not implemented)
- Spending progress bars with semantic colors (50% → 80% → 99% → limit)
- Charge pattern tracking per card

## PRD Alignment Notes

### Alignment Points

| PRD Feature | Brainstorming Validation |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| BurnerCard System | Fully validated + enhanced with visual branding, configurable automation |
| Subscription Tracker | Validated + enhanced with health indicators, calendar view |
| Price-Increase Alerts | Validated + expanded to global price intelligence |
| Cancellation Link Management | Validated (cancellation links, not automatic cancellation) |
| Savings Dashboard | Validated + enhanced with shareable milestones |

### Potential Divergence: Pricing Model

**PRD defines:**
- Free tier: Up to 3 subs, manual cancel links, renewal alerts
- Pro ($9.99/mo): Unlimited subs, auto price alerts, alt suggestions
- Saver+ ($16.99/mo): BurnerCard access (4 cards/mo), custom rules

**Brainstorming recommends:**
- Premium-only with generous trial (no free tier)
- Rationale: Premium users = 7x LTV, free tier dilutes brand

**Decision needed:** Reconcile these approaches or test both.

---

## Strategic Narrative

**The roadmap reveals a clear story:**

- **P0:** "You can manage subscriptions and we'll remind you"
- **P1:** "Your subscriptions are PROTECTED with smart cards"
- **P2:** "Klard is actively watching out for you"
- **P3:** "Klard works for you anywhere in the world"

Each phase adds a layer of value that justifies continued subscription.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Card Provider Decision:** Research Airwallex vs. Lithic vs. Stripe for Canada + US support
2. ~~**Pricing Model Decision:** Free tier vs. premium-only with trial~~ ✅ **DECIDED: Premium-only with 14-day trial**
3. **Epic Creation:** Use this session to inform feature epics
4. **Design System Application:** Ensure all concepts align with Klard Design System

**Session completed successfully.**
