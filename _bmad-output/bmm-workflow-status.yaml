  Building application flows (screens + backend). Just finished login flows
  with passkey integration. Goals:
  - Enhance signup page
  - Enhance other existing screens
  - Implement remaining application features

  Analysis:
  - Working auth backend (7 methods) + UI component library (134 components)
  - Core subscription management features need to be built from scratch
  - 30+ screens to implement
  - No subscription CRUD API exists yet

  Approach: Platform PRD → Feature Epics
  - Existing platform-level PRD will be used to create feature epics
  - Each epic becomes detailed implementation unit with stories
