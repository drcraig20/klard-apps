## Brand Voice & Positioning

### Core Message: Empowerment, Not Fear

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Confident, not cocky** | 'Your card blocked a charge' not 'We saved you again!' |
| **Warm, not corporate** | 'Heads up—Netflix raised prices' not 'Price increase alert detected' |
| **Empowering, not fearful** | 'Try anything' not 'Protect yourself from scams' |
| **Clear, not clever** | 'One-time card: works once, then locks' not 'Use it and lose it!' |

### Messaging Framework

| Context | Message |
|---------|---------|
| **Primary tagline** | Subscribe fearlessly. |
| **BurnerCard value** | Try anything. Cancel nothing. Your card handles it. |
| **Privacy positioning** | Your data stays yours—we never ask for bank access. |
| **Trial protection** | Explore freely—your BurnerCard has your back. |
| **Blocked charge notification** | 🛡️ Blocked: $14.99 from TrialService. Your BurnerCard did its job. |

### What Klard Is NOT

- Not a security product (we're a freedom product)
- Not a budgeting app (we're about control, not restriction)
- Not a bank (we're the card between you and the world)
