## 1. Strategic Alignment Issues

### 1.1 Pricing Model Mismatch

**Current State:**
```
Basic: $3/mo (or free?) - Up to 5 subscriptions
Pro: $9.99/mo - Unlimited + price alerts
Saver+: $16.99/mo - BurnerCards + rules
```

**Required State (per Product Brief 2025-12-21):**
```
Pro: $12.99/mo ($119/yr annual) - Unlimited subs, email scanning, price alerts
Saver+: $19.99/mo ($179/yr annual) - + BurnerCards (4/mo), custom rules, savings reports
```

**Rationale:** Product Brief explicitly states:
> "Premium-only with 14-day free trial (no credit card required). No free tier. Research shows premium users generate 7x higher LTV ($55.21 vs $8.08)."

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Remove Basic tier entirely
- [ ] Update Pro price to $12.99/mo
- [ ] Update Saver+ price to $19.99/mo
- [ ] Add prominent "14-day free trial" messaging
- [ ] Update annual pricing to $119/yr (Pro) and $179/yr (Saver+)
- [ ] Update feature comparison table to remove Basic column

### 1.2 Trial Messaging Missing

**Current State:** "Starting at $3/month. Try Klard for 14 days."

**Required State:** "Try free for 14 days. No credit card required."

**Placement:** Should appear:
1. Hero section (primary CTA area)
2. Pricing section header
3. Each pricing card

### 1.3 Conflicting Discount Offers

**Current State:**
- Hero: "First 1,000 users get lifetime 50% off"
- Early Access section: "30% off Pro plan forever"

**Required State:** Single consistent offer across all touchpoints.

**Recommendation:** Standardize on "First 1,000 users get lifetime 50% off" (more compelling) OR align with validated strategy.

---

## 2. Brand Voice & Messaging

### 2.1 Tagline Alignment

**Product Brief Brand Voice:**

| Attribute | Guideline | Current Violation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Empowering, not fearful | Focus on freedom, not danger | Hero: "Stop Paying..." (fear-based) |
| Confident, not cocky | We know we're good, but don't brag | OK |
| Warm, not corporate | Talk like a smart friend | OK |
| Clear, not clever | Clarity beats puns | OK |

**Current Taglines Used:**
- Meta title: "Stop Paying for Subscriptions You Forgot About" ❌ Fear-based
- Logo tagline: "Track. Detect. Protect." ❌ Old tagline
- Footer: "Track. Detect. Protect. Stop paying for what you don't use." ❌ Old

**Required Primary Tagline:** "Subscribe fearlessly."

**Recommended Hero Copy:**
```
Subscribe fearlessly.

Try any service. Block any charge.
No bank access required.

[Email] [Join Waitlist →]

"First 1,000 users get lifetime 50% off"
```

### 2.2 Notification Tone Examples

Update any in-page notification examples to match brand voice:

| Moment | Generic (Current) | Klard Voice (Required) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Blocked charge | "Transaction declined" | "🛡️ Blocked: $14.99 from TrialService. Your BurnerCard did its job." |
| Price increase | "Price change detected" | "📈 Heads up: Spotify went from $12.99 → $14.99. Want to see alternatives?" |

```
Basic ($3/mo) | Pro ($9.99/mo) | Saver+ ($16.99/mo)

     ↑ "Most Popular"
```

### 4.2 Updated Feature Allocation

---

## 5. Data Capture Enhancement

### 5.1 Current Form Analysis

**Hero Form Fields:**
- Email (required) ✓
- Hidden fields (CSRF, form ID, session) ✓
- Country ❌ Missing
- Monthly spend ❌ Missing
- Referral source ❌ Missing

**Early Access Form Fields:**
- Same structure, missing same fields

### 5.2 Required Form Fields

```html
<form>
  <!-- Existing fields -->
  <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" required />

  <!-- NEW: Country selection -->
  <select name="country" required>
    <option value="">Select country</option>
    <option value="CA">🇨🇦 Canada</option>
    <option value="US">🇺🇸 United States</option>
    <option value="GB">🇬🇧 United Kingdom</option>
    <option value="EU">🇪🇺 European Union</option>
    <option value="OTHER">Other</option>
  </select>

  <!-- NEW: Monthly spend (optional but valuable) -->
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Monthly subscription spend</legend>
    <label><input type="radio" name="spend" value="0-50" /> $0-50</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="spend" value="50-100" /> $50-100</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="spend" value="100-200" /> $100-200</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="spend" value="200+" /> $200+</label>
  </fieldset>

  <button type="submit">Join Waitlist</button>
</form>
```

### 5.3 Why This Matters

| Field | GTM Value |
|-------|-----------|
| Country | Validate Airwallex region coverage (CA, US, UK, EU) |
| Monthly spend | Segment high-value users ($200+ = Harper persona) |
| Referral source | Track organic vs. paid channel effectiveness |

### 5.4 UTM Parameter Handling

Ensure the page captures and stores UTM parameters:

```javascript
// On page load
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const utmSource = urlParams.get('utm_source');
const utmMedium = urlParams.get('utm_medium');
const utmCampaign = urlParams.get('utm_campaign');

// Include in form submission
```

## 6. Design & UX Improvements

### 6.1 Typography Assessment

**Frontend Design Skill Guidelines:**
> "Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter."

**Recommendations:**
- Verify current font stack is distinctive
- Consider display font for headlines (e.g., Cabinet Grotesk, Satoshi, General Sans)
- Body font should be refined but readable
- Ensure font pairing creates hierarchy

### 6.2 Visual Hierarchy Issues

| Issue | Current | Recommended |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Viral moment placement | BurnerCard section (below fold) | Above fold in hero |
| "Blocked charge" notification | Small, in feature section | Large, prominent, animated |
| Trial messaging | Buried in pricing | Hero + every CTA |
| Social proof | None | Founder story or early tester quotes |

### 6.3 Motion & Micro-interactions

**Frontend Design Skill Guidelines:**
> "Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions."

**Recommendations:**
1. Hero entrance animation (staggered text reveal)
2. BurnerCard flip animation (already present - good!)
3. "Blocked charge" notification entrance (slide in from right)
4. Scroll-triggered reveals for feature sections

### 6.4 Color & Theme Consistency

Per Klard Design System:

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Primary | #0D7C7A (light) / #15B5B0 (dark) | CTAs, interactive elements |
| Background | #FFFFFF (light) / #0F172A (dark) | Base surfaces |
| Success/Savings | #059669 / #10B981 | Money saved indicators |

**Verify:** All CTAs use primary teal consistently.

### 6.5 BurnerCard Visual Enhancement

The BurnerCard flip card is excellent. Enhancements:
- Larger size for mobile
- Add subtle glow/shadow for depth
- Consider showing multiple card types (One-time, Recurring, Category)

---

## 7. Content Corrections

### 7.1 False or Aspirational Claims

| Claim | Issue | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| "Join thousands taking control" | False - pre-launch | Remove or change to "Be among the first" |
| "99% success blocking unwanted charges" | Unverified | Remove or soften to "designed to block" |
| "Most users set up in under 5 minutes" | Unverified | Remove until validated |

### 7.2 FAQ Corrections

| FAQ | Issue | Correction |
|-----|-------|------------|
| "Does Klard work for teams?" | Mentions Team plan that doesn't exist | "Team features coming in Phase 3" |
| "When will Klard launch?" | Says "30-50% discount" | Align with hero offer |

### 7.3 Footer Updates

| Element | Current | Required |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Tagline | "Track. Detect. Protect." | "Subscribe fearlessly." |
| Social links | All point to "#" | Add real links or remove |
| Privacy Policy | Points to "#" | Create and link actual page |
| Terms of Service | Points to "#" | Create and link actual page |

---

## 8. Technical Fixes

### 8.1 Broken Links

| Link | Current | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| Privacy Policy | href="#" | Create `/privacy` page |
| Terms of Service | href="#" | Create `/terms` page |
| About | href="#" | Create `/about` page or remove |
| Twitter | href="#" | Add real link or remove |
| LinkedIn | href="#" | Add real link or remove |
| GitHub | href="#" | Add real link or remove |

### 8.2 Analytics Implementation

**Required Events (PostHog):**

```javascript
// Page load
posthog.capture('landing_page_view', {
  source: utm_source,
  medium: utm_medium,
  campaign: utm_campaign
});

// Form interactions
posthog.capture('waitlist_form_start');
posthog.capture('waitlist_country_selected', { country: value });
posthog.capture('waitlist_spend_selected', { spend_range: value });
posthog.capture('waitlist_signup', {
  country,
  spend_range,
  form_location: 'hero' | 'early_access'
});

// Engagement
posthog.capture('burnercard_flip', { location: 'feature_section' });
posthog.capture('pricing_toggle', { billing: 'monthly' | 'annual' });
posthog.capture('faq_expanded', { question_id });
posthog.capture('feature_comparison_viewed');
```

### 8.3 SEO Optimization

| Element | Current | Recommended |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Title | "Klard - Stop Paying for Subscriptions You Forgot About" | "Klard - Subscribe Fearlessly \| Virtual Cards for Subscription Control" |
| Meta description | Check/add | "Try any service, block any charge. Klard's BurnerCards protect you from unwanted renewals. No bank access required. Try free for 14 days." |
| OG Image | Check/add | Create shareable card with "Subscribe fearlessly" + BurnerCard visual |
| Structured data | Check/add | SoftwareApplication schema |

---

## 9. Mobile Optimization

### 9.1 Responsive Breakpoints

Verify proper behavior at:
- 320px (small mobile)
- 375px (iPhone SE/standard)
- 390px (iPhone 14)
- 768px (tablet)
- 1024px (laptop)
- 1440px (desktop)

### 9.2 Mobile-Specific Concerns

| Element | Concern | Recommendation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Hero headline | May wrap poorly | Test and adjust font-size |
| Form fields | Country/spend dropdowns | Ensure native select UX |
| BurnerCard | May be too small | Increase mobile size |
| Feature comparison table | Horizontal scroll | Consider accordion for mobile |
| Navigation | Hamburger menu exists | Verify menu opens correctly |

### 9.3 Touch Targets

Ensure all buttons/links meet 44x44px minimum touch target.
