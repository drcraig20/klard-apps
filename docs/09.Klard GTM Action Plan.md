```
"I went through the same thing last month — found out I was paying for
6 subscriptions I'd completely forgotten about. Ended up saving ~$87/month
just by auditing my email for receipts.

Pro tip: Search your inbox for "subscription" "renewal" "will be charged" —
you'll be horrified and relieved at the same time."
```

**Reddit Comment (Soft Mention):**
```
"The trial trap is real. I got charged $79 for software I used for
one assignment.

What finally worked for me was using virtual cards that auto-lock after
the trial period. Actually building a tool for this — happy to share
when it's ready if anyone's interested."
```

**Indie Hackers Update:**
```
Title: "Building Klard: Week [X] Update"

What I built this week:
- [Feature/milestone]

What I learned:
- [Insight about users/market]

Next week:
- [Upcoming focus]

Would love feedback on [specific question].
