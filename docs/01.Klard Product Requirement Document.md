| **Project Name** | Klard |

| **Document Status** | Draft |
| **Project Manager** | @Gbenga Tofade, Bukola Tofade |
| **Architect** | @Gbenga Tofade  |
| **Team** | @Gbenga Tofade Bukola Tofade |
| **Project Scope** | **MVP** (Minimum Viable product) |
| **Timeline** | 3 months |

## Product Name: **Klard**

**Tagline:** *Track. Detect. Protect. Stop paying for what you don’t use.*

---

## 1. Vision Statement

> Klard is a privacy-first, all-in-one subscription intelligence and protection platform.
> 
> 
> It empowers individuals, freelancers, and small teams to take total control over their recurring payments by tracking subscriptions, detecting price increases, suggesting cheaper alternatives, and blocking unwanted renewals with disposable virtual cards governed by user-defined rules.
> 

Our mission is simple:

**Help people stop money leaks and keep their digital spending under control without sharing their bank credentials.**

---

## 2. Background & Context

Subscription-based billing has exploded across industries, from streaming, software, utilities, and even groceries.

While convenient, it’s created a growing **“leakage economy”**, where users unknowingly lose hundreds per year due to:

- Forgotten renewals,
- Hidden price hikes,
- Hard-to-find cancellation links, and
- Frictionless re-billing by aggressive vendors.

Existing tools like **Rocket Money** and **Truebill** attempt to solve this, but require full banking access and provide limited control.

**Privacy.com** allow single-use cards but don’t integrate subscription awareness or renewal logic.

**Klard** bridges these worlds — combining **subscription intelligence + disposable card protection** in a unified, user-centric SaaS.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

**End-users today face 5 recurring pain points:**

1. They feel **unsafe** giving **credit**-**card** details to **unknown** **vendors**.
2. They **lack automated controls** to **block renewals** once a **trial** or **one-time payment** completes.
3. They **can’t easily view** all their **active subscriptions** or **renewal timelines** in one place.
4. They often miss **price increases** until after charges occur.
5. They can’t easily find **how to cancel** a service.

These issues directly cost consumers and freelancers hundreds or thousands yearly and erode financial trust in digital commerce.

### 5.4 BurnerCard System (“Klard Pay-Once”)

The **BurnerCard** is the heart of Klard’s financial control layer.

**Primary Purpose:**

Enable users to create **virtual payment cards** tied to subscription rules and automatically block any unauthorized renewals or price hikes.

**Core Workflow:**

1. User requests a new BurnerCard via the dashboard.
2. Klard backend (Spring service) invokes an issuing API (e.g., **Lithic**, or **Airwallex Issuing**).
3. Card metadata (masked PAN, expiry, limits) returned and securely stored.
4. User uses the card to pay for a subscription.
5. Klard monitors charge events via webhooks.
6. Based on user-defined rules, the system **auto-locks**, **limits**, or **deletes** the card.

**Rule Configuration Options:**

| Rule | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Card Type** | One-time (single transaction), Recurring-limited, or Category-locked. |
| **Linked Subscription** | Card can be tied to a single `subscription_id`. |
| **Linked Category** | Limit use to specific category (e.g., “Streaming” or “Productivity”). |
| **Max Recurring Count** | For recurring cards, user can specify **max N charges** before **auto-lock**. |
| **Spending Limit** | Hard cap (e.g., $20 total). |
| **Expiry Rule** | Auto-lock after **X days** even if unused. |
| **Notification Rule** | Alert user when 80 % of limit reached or when next charge attempt occurs. |

**System Behaviors:**

- Auto-block after rule breach.
- Decline unauthorized merchant attempts.
- Mark subscription as “Blocked” or “Completed.”
- Log savings event in dashboard: *“$14.99 charge prevented — card expired.”*

---

**Widgets:**

- *Total Subscriptions Tracked*
- *Total Monthly Spend*
- *Renewals Blocked This Month*
- *Total Savings to Date*

- **Price Increase:** “Spotify Premium rose from $12.99 → $14.99.”
- **Card Action:** “Your BurnerCard for Netflix auto-locked after final payment.”

## 8. User Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Trial Protection**

**Hannah** wants to try a new online design tool offering a 7-day trial. She uses Klard’s **“Create BurnerCard”** feature, selects *One-time*, sets merchant = Designly, and expiry = 7 days. After she pays, the card auto-locks. When Designly attempts to renew, Klard declines it and emails Hannah: *“Your BurnerCard blocked a $19.99 renewal — you saved money.”*

**Scenario 2: Price-Increase Detection**

**Felix’s** Canva subscription renews monthly. Klard’s price engine detects a new price in Canva’s public page. Felix receives:

> “Your Canva Pro plan increased from $12.99 → $14.99. Click here for cheaper alternatives.”
> 
> 
> He switches via an affiliate discount, saving $24/year.
> 

**Scenario 3: Cancellation Made Simple**

**Sam** adds “Spotify Student Plan” manually. **Klard** auto-populates the official Spotify cancellation URL. When he decides to cancel, he clicks *Cancel → Open in Spotify → Done*. The system marks it *Cancelled* and removes it from renewals.

**Scenario 4: Category-Limited Card**

Amy’s agency issues a card limited to the “Design Software” category, with a monthly cap of $50. Klard enforces the category and declines unrelated charges, maintaining budget discipline automatically.
